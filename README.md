# forceScreenshot
This is a program to take a screenshot of your screen. Works great for when the subject of the screenshot blurs itself with printscreen.

Download both files and put them in a folder where you won't delete it.

Open a terminal and run ```pip install mss keyboard```

Create a shortcut of the .bat file, name it ```Force Screenshot```.

Go to C:\Users\//USERNAME//\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs

Paste your shortcut, edit icon with icon provided in source code.

Press the windows key, type Force Screenshot.

Enjoy!
